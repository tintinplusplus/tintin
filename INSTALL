Installation is easy; cd to the src/ directory, then type this:

./configure

make

make install

If this went without errors or serious warnings type this to start tintin:

tt++

You might need to compile and install the following libraries:

pcre: http://pcre.org
zlib: http://zlib.net


Options configure currently supports:

--enable-big5   To use the big5 encoding for Chinese characters.

If you wish, you can edit src/Makefile.in before running ./configure.
It shouldn't be necessary unless you have some unorthodox request
(such as wanting to install tintin++ /usr/local).

If you have any trouble with installing/compiling tintin, you can ask for
assistance on the forum.


TERMINAL EMULATION:

In order to run tintin full featured you will need a vt100 emulator. If your
OS doesn't use one per default it's suggested to install xterm or rxvt (also
known as wterm). If you are using cygwin for example you might want to do the
following:

cat x < rxvt -bg 0 -fg 15 -cr 2 -fn "courier-15" -fb "courier-15" +sb -tn xterm -e /usr/bin/bash --login -i&
chmod 777 x
./x

This will start up rxvt configured as an old school PuTTY terminal everytime
you type ./x  and allows you to run tintin in split mode.
